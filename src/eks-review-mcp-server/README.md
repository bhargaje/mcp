# Amazon EKS Review MCP Server

The Amazon EKS Review MCP Server provides AI code assistants with comprehensive assessment tools to evaluate Amazon EKS clusters against AWS best practices. This server enables large language models (LLMs) to perform automated reviews across five critical domains: networking, security, resiliency, Karpenter configuration, and Cluster Autoscaler setup. By integrating this server into AI code assistants, development teams can proactively identify configuration issues, security vulnerabilities, and optimization opportunities in their EKS infrastructure.

The EKS Review MCP Server streamlines the cluster assessment process by automatically analyzing cluster configurations, identifying non-compliant resources, and providing detailed findings that AI assistants can use to generate context-aware remediation guidance. This approach transforms complex EKS best practices documentation into actionable insights, helping teams maintain secure, resilient, and well-architected Kubernetes environments.

## Key Features

* Performs comprehensive networking assessments including cluster endpoint access control, multi-AZ node distribution, VPC configuration, subnet capacity validation, and security group settings.
* Evaluates security posture across IAM/RBAC configurations, pod security standards, encryption settings, secrets management, and infrastructure security controls.
* Assesses resiliency through 28 checks covering application workloads (pod controllers, replicas, health probes, PDBs), control plane configuration, and data plane infrastructure including autoscaling (HPA/VPA/CA) and monitoring.
* Reviews Karpenter best practices including deployment configuration, NodePool settings, instance selection strategies, and spot instance optimization.
* Analyzes Cluster Autoscaler configuration including deployment health, version compatibility, auto-discovery settings, and node group configurations.
* Automatically detects EKS Auto Mode clusters and skips Karpenter/Cluster Autoscaler checks when not applicable.
* Optimizes performance by fetching Kubernetes resources once and sharing them across all checks, minimizing API calls.
* Returns structured check results with compliance status, impacted resources, configuration details, and severity levels for AI-driven remediation.

## Prerequisites

* [Install Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
* [Install the `uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
* [Install and configure the AWS CLI with credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
* [Install and configure kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

## Setup

Add these IAM policies to the IAM role or user that you use to review your EKS clusters.

### Required IAM Permissions

The EKS Review MCP Server requires read-only access to EKS clusters and related AWS resources:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "eks:DescribeCluster",
        "eks:ListClusters",
        "eks:DescribeNodegroup",
        "eks:ListNodegroups",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
        "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "iam:GetRole",
        "iam:GetRolePolicy",
        "iam:ListRolePolicies",
        "iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies",
        "iam:GetPolicy",
        "iam:GetPolicyVersion"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Kubernetes API Access Requirements

All Kubernetes API operations will only work when one of the following conditions is met:

1. The user's principal (IAM role/user) actually created the EKS cluster being accessed
2. An EKS Access Entry has been configured for the user's principal

If you encounter authorization errors when using Kubernetes API operations, verify that an access entry has been properly configured for your principal.

1. **Read-Only Operations**: All checks are read-only and do not modify cluster configuration
2. **AWS Authentication**: Uses AWS credentials from the environment for secure authentication
3. **Kubernetes Authentication**: Generates temporary credentials for Kubernetes API access
4. **SSL Verification**: Enforces SSL verification for all Kubernetes API calls
5. **Client Caching**: Caches Kubernetes clients with TTL-based expiration for security and performance
6. **Resource Sharing**: Fetches Kubernetes resources once and shares across checks to minimize API calls

### Considerations

When using the EKS Review MCP Server, consider the following:

* **AWS Credentials**: The server needs read-only permissions to EKS and related AWS resources
* **Kubernetes Access**: The server requires read access to Kubernetes API for resource inspection
* **Network Security**: Ensure network connectivity to EKS cluster endpoints
* **Authentication**: Use appropriate authentication mechanisms for Kubernetes API access
* **Authorization**: Configure RBAC with read-only permissions for cluster assessment

### `autoApprove` (optional)

An array within the MCP server definition that lists tool names to be automatically approved by the EKS Review MCP Server client, bypassing user confirmation for those specific tools. For example:

**For Mac/Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.eks-review-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.eks-review-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "eks-review-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      },
      "autoApprove": [
        "check_eks_networking",
        "check_eks_security",
        "check_eks_resiliency",
        "check_karpenter_best_practices",
        "check_cluster_autoscaler_best_practices"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.eks-review-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "awslabs.eks-review-mcp-server@latest",
        "awslabs.eks-review-mcp-server.exe"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "eks-review-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      },
      "autoApprove": [
        "check_eks_networking",
        "check_eks_security",
        "check_eks_resiliency",
        "check_karpenter_best_practices",
        "check_cluster_autoscaler_best_practices"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

* **Regular Assessments**: Run checks regularly to identify configuration drift and new issues
* **Comprehensive Reviews**: Run all five tools for a complete cluster assessment
* **Prioritize by Severity**: Address High severity findings first, then Medium and Low
* **Namespace Scoping**: Use namespace parameter to focus assessments on specific workloads
* **Combine with Monitoring**: Use assessment results alongside monitoring data for complete visibility
* **Document Findings**: Keep records of assessment results and remediation actions
* **Automate Reviews**: Integrate checks into CI/CD pipelines for continuous compliance

## Troubleshooting

* **Permission Errors**: Verify that your AWS credentials have the necessary read permissions for EKS and related services
* **Kubernetes API Errors**: Verify that the EKS cluster is running and accessible, and that you have proper access entry configured
* **Network Issues**: Check VPC and security group configurations allow connectivity to cluster endpoints
* **Client Errors**: Verify that the MCP client is configured correctly with proper environment variables
* **Log Level**: Increase the log level to DEBUG for more detailed logs: `"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"`
